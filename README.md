# Hexagon Chess
=======

**Hexagon Chess** is an adaptation of the classic chess game played on a hexagonal grid, based on Gliński's variant: [Hexagonal Chess - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_chess). This game is designed to provide a unique twist on traditional chess, taking advantage of the geometry of a hexagonal board and introducing new strategic possibilities. Though based on Gliński's variant, additional game modes and rule sets are planned for future releases.

## Current Progress

- **Game Logic**: Mostly finished, pieces capture and move how one would expect, though more testing is needed
- **Board Rendering**: The hexagonal game board has been successfully drawn and colored, providing a clear and visually appealing layout.
- **Piece Rendering**: Work is ongoing to render chess pieces on the board. This feature is the next major milestone in the project, ensuring that players can interact with the pieces as they would in a regular chess game.
