# Hexagon Chess
=======

**Hexagon Chess** is an adaptation of the classic chess game played on a hexagonal grid, based on Gliński's variant: [Hexagonal Chess - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_chess). This game is designed to provide a unique twist on traditional chess, taking advantage of the geometry of a hexagonal board and introducing new strategic possibilities. Though based on Gliński's variant, additional game modes and rule sets are planned for future releases.

## Current Progress

- **Game Logic**: Mostly finished, finilizing win conditions and game restarting
- **Board Rendering**: The hexagonal game board has been successfully drawn and colored, providing a clear and visually appealing layout.
- **Piece Rendering**: Pieces are rendered, and move as one would expect. Future changes involve highlighting possible moves for a piece, highlighting the piece itself when it is selected, and animations for movement rather than teleportation
